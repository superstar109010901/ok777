        Gambling Awareness and Protecting Minors

        Betting in online casinos is primarily for entertainment purposes.
        However, a small percentage of people lose control when gambling. Before
        you start playing games, it's important to understand that gaming should
        not be viewed as a source of income or a means to pay off debt. It is
        beneficial to keep track of the time and money spent at online casinos
        on a daily basis. MAGIC88 HASH only accepts players over the age of 18
        and uses all applicable methods to prevent minors from registering and
        playing at our casino. The casino reserves the right to require players
        to provide proof of identity and will deny access to the site if the
        player is under the legal gambling age. However, we recognize that due
        to the widespread availability of the Internet, persons under the age of
        18 may still register and play at online casinos. Therefore, we strongly
        encourage parents to work together to protect their children from
        visiting gambling sites. There is specialized software that can help
        with this situation. For more information, please visit the websites
        listed below.
